      <h1 id="hello-aerpaw">Hello, AERPAW</h1>

      <p>
        AERPAW is a wireless research platform for experiments involving
        advanced wireless technologies (such as 5G) and autonomous drones.
      </p>

      <p>
        AERPAW experiments begin in Development Mode, in the AERPAW Virtual
        Environment, before they are deployed on the physical testbed in live
        flight. In this tutorial, you will configure the software you’ll need on
        your own device, create an account on AERPAW, and run an example
        experiment in the AERPAW Virtual Environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the example experiment, you will run a radio transmitter on a ground
        vehicle, and then manually move it to a desired position. Then, you will
        run a radio receiver on an aerial vehicle, fly it past the ground
        vehicle, and observe how the received signal strength increases (as you
        get closer to the ground vehicle) and decreases (as you get farther from
        the ground vehicle).
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          [!NOTE] This process has a “human in the loop” approval stage -
          students will need to wait for AERPAW staff to approve their account,
          then again for an instructor or research advisor to approve their
          request to join their project. They should be prepared to start the
          tutorial, wait for these approvals, and then continue.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="prepare-your-workstation">Prepare your workstation</h2>

      <p>
        To use AERPAW, you’ll need to prepare your workstation (the laptop or PC
        you are going to use for your experiments) with the following software:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Terminal application for SSH (and keys)</li>
        <li>QGroundControl</li>
        <li>OpenVPN</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="terminal-application">Terminal application</h4>

      <p>
        You will need a terminal application with SSH to connect to your AERPAW
        resources. You may use the built-in terminal on Linux or Mac. On
        Windows, you may use <a href="https://cmder.app/">cmder</a> or any other
        terminal application that has an SSH client.
      </p>

      <h4 id="qgroundcontrol">QGroundControl</h4>

      <p>
        AERPAW uses QGroundControl to monitor and control moving vehicles -
        including ground and aerial vehicles - during experiments in the AERPAW
        Virtual Environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        To install QGroundControl, follow the instructions in the
        <a
          href="https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/Stable_V4.3/en/qgc-user-guide/getting_started/download_and_install.html"
          >QGroundControlGuide</a
        >
        for your specific platform (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
      </p>

      <p>
        During the setup, you will be prompted to specify certain settings,
        please use:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Measurement units: use metric system, specify horizontal and vertical
          distance in meters, speed in kilometers/hour, and area in square
          meters
        </li>
        <li>Autopilot: ArduPilot</li>
      </ul>

      <p>

          src="https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/hello-aerpaw/images/qgc-setup.png"
          alt=""
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        When you run QGroundControl for the first time, it will look like this:
      </p>

      <p>

          alt=""
        />
      </p>

      <h4 id="openvpn">OpenVPN</h4>

      <p>
        To connect to resources in the AERPAW virtual environment, you will need
        to set up a VPN connection from your own device to the AERPAW
        environment, using an OpenVPN client.
      </p>

      <p>
        The

          >AERPAW User Manual</a
        >
        recommends:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          On Linux: OpenVPN version 2 (not Version 3, which does not support
          AERPAW VPNs). It can be installed on Ubuntu with
          <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
            >sudo apt install openvpn</code
          >, or on any Linux distribution by installing
          <a href="https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/">from source</a>.

      </ul>

      <h2 id="create-an-account-on-aerpaw">Create an account on AERPAW</h2>

      <p>Before you can run an experiment on AERPAW, you will need to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>create an account</li>
        <li>edit your profile</li>
        <li>add SSH keys to your profile</li>
        <li>request an experimenter role</li>
        <li>join a project</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="create-your-aerpaw-account">Create your AERPAW account</h4>

      <p>First, you will create an account on the AERPAW experiment portal.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          From the AERPAW website
          <a href="https://aerpaw.org">https://aerpaw.org</a>, click “Experiment
          Web Portal” from the menu.
        </li>
        <li>Choose “Login” in the top right.</li>
        <li>Click on “AERPAW Login.”</li>
        <li>
          In the “Select Identity Provider” section, click on the dropdown menu
          and find your institution. Then, click “Log On”. You will be
          redirected to log in using your institutional credentials.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, you will be returned to the AERPAW experiment portal homepage,
          but you will see a navigation bar at the top of the page with
          additional item (“Profile”) and “Logout” instead of “Login”,
          indicating that you are now logged in.
        </li>
        <li>
          On your first login, you will also receive an email welcoming you to
          AERPAW.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          In some cases, after Step 3, you may still be logged out and have to
          repeat steps 2 through 4 a second time. This is a known issue related
          to the way identity-related information is cached and sent by your
          browser.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h4 id="edit-your-aerpaw-profile">Edit your AERPAW profile</h4>

      <p>
        Before you can use AERPAW, you are required to update your profile to
        provide some basic information about yourself. The AERPAW team will
        review this information to confirm that you are eligible to use AERPAW.
      </p>

      <p>Once you are logged in to the AERPAW experiment portal,</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Click “Profile” in the navigation bar at the top.</li>
        <li>
          In the “Employer/Organization” field, indicate your affiliation (e.g.
          your school).
        </li>
        <li>
          In the “Position/Title” field, indicate your position (e.g. “Student”,
          “Summer Research Intern”, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          Describe your anticipated use of AERPAW in the “Field of Research”
          field. You can write something like “Run wireless network experiments”
          or “Lab assignment for my course with Prof. Fraida Fund” or similar.
        </li>
        <li>Click “Save Updates” to save your entries.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4 id="generate-ssh-keys">Generate SSH keys</h4>

      <p>
        Next, you will add SSH keys to your AERPAW profile. You will use these
        keys when connecting to resources in the AERPAW virtual environment.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Note: If you already have an SSH key pair, you can use it with AERPAW
          - copy the contents of the public key, then skip to the “Upload SSH
          keys to your AERPAW profile” section and continue there. If you don’t
          already have an SSH key pair, continue with the rest of this section.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        SSH public-key authentication uses a pair of separate keys (i.e., a key
        pair): one “private” key, which you keep a secret, and the other
        “public”. A key pair has a special property: any message that is
        encrypted with your private key can only be decrypted with your public
        key, and any message that is encrypted with your public key can only be
        decrypted with your private key.
      </p>

      <p>
        This property can be exploited for authenticating login to a remote
        machine. First, you upload the public key to a special location on the
        remote machine. Then, when you want to log in to the machine:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          You use a special argument with your SSH command to let your SSH
          application know that you are going to use a key, and the location of
          your private key. If the private key is protected by a passphrase, you
          may be prompted to enter the passphrase (this is not a password for
          the remote machine, though).
        </li>
        <li>
          The machine you are logging in to will ask your SSH client to “prove”
          that it owns the (secret) private key that matches an authorized
          public key. To do this, the machine will send a random message to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your SSH client will encrypt the random message with the private key
          and send it back to the remote machine.
        </li>
        <li>
          The remote machine will decrypt the message with your public key. If
          the decrypted message matches the message it sent you, it has “proof”
          that you are in possession of the private key for that key pair, and
          will grant you access (without using an account password on the remote
          machine.)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>(Of course, this relies on you keeping your private key a secret.)</p>

      <p>
        We’re going to generate a key pair on our laptop, then upload it to our
        AERPAW profile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Open a terminal, and generate a key named
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id_rsa_aerpaw</code>:
      </p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_aerpaw
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Follow the prompts to generate and save the key pair. The output should
        look something like this:
      </p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">

        If you use a passphrase, make a note of it somewhere safe! (You don’t
        have to use a passphrase, though - feel free to leave that empty for no
        passphrase.)
      </p>

      <p>
        You will need the contents of your public key in the next step. To see
