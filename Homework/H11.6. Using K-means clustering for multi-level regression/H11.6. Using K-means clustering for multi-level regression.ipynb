    "You are working for a non-profit organization that wants to develop a machine learning model to predict which of the people they engage with are likely to volunteer their time for community service. To train your model, you have a dataset that includes survey data about volunteering from respondents across the United States. However, you realize that volunteering behavior is very region-specific. So you want to first cluster data by geographic features, then fit a new linear model on volunteering-related features in each cluster.\n",
