    "You are a machine learning engineer working in the finance industry. The goal of your current project is to help investors improve portfolio diversity by letting them know which stocks are likely to \"move together\" - i.e. increase at the same time (e.g. because of a new development in their common industry) or decrease at the same time (e.g. because of a war in their common geographical home base.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a historical dataset of daily stock movement (difference between closing price of the stock, and price when it opens), you decide to use K means clustering to find groups of stocks that \"move together\". You will assign stocks to clusters, with a few different values of \"number of clusters\" (so that the finance experts can decide which are most useful for them). You will save the cluster indices assigned by the default K means clustering algorithm in sklearn to a variable `c_idx_def`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it's not meaningful in this context to have a cluster with only a few stocks, you will also post-process the clusters as follows: whenever the default K means clustering finds a cluster with fewer than 3 samples, you will re-assign each of the samples in this cluster to its nearest cluster (by Euclidean distance to cluster center) of a cluster that had 3 or more samples assigned to it by the default K means clustering. You will save your modified version of the cluster indices in `c_idx_mod`.\n",
