    "On a virtual reality gaming platform, players from across the world engage in an immersive multiplayer experience. The gaming company is facing a challenge in predicting player engagement levels and optimizing in-game events to enhance the overall player experience. As a data scientist on the gaming analytics team, your goal is to build a model to predict the player engagement category based on their long-term and recent engagement patterns. This model will enable the gaming company to tailor in-game events, challenges, and rewards to different player segments, fostering a more engaging and personalized gaming experience for players across the virtual universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train your model, you are given a dataset with information on several million players, and each player is described by the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player ID (alphanumeric): Unique identifier for each player.\n",
    "- Total Playtime (numeric): The cumulative time a player has spent in the game, over the player's lifetime.\n",
    "- Average Session Duration (numeric): The average duration of a player's gaming sessions, over the player's lifetime.\n",
    "- Average Sessions Per Week (numeric): The average number gaming sessions a player has engaged in per week, over the player's lifetime.\n",
    "- In-Game Purchases (numeric): The total amount spent on in-game purchases, over the player's lifetime.\n",
    "- Quest Completion Rate (numeric): The percentage of quests a player has successfully completed, over the player's lifetime.\n",
    "- Social Interactions (numeric): A count of in-game social interactions with other players, over the player's lifetime.\n",
    "- Guild Membership (binary): Indicates whether the player is currently a member of an in-game guild.\n",
    "- Player Level (numeric): The player's current level in the game.\n",
    "- Days Elapsed Since Last Three Sessions (numeric, three values):\n",
    "  - The number of days that have elapsed since the player's most recent gaming session,\n",
    "  - the number of days that have elapsed since the previous gaming session,\n",
    "  - and the number of days that have elapsed since the gaming session before that,\n",
    "- Player Engagement Category: high-engagement (2), moderate-engagement (1), or low-engagement (0) (class labels assigned by experts, ordinal encoded)\n",
