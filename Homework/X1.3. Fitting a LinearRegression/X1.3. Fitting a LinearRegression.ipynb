Then, the quality of their code was evaluated and recorded. Each sample includes the following columns:\n",

Then, you will fit a `LinearRegression` (using the `sklearn` implementation, you may refer to its documentation [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html)) on the training set, and evaluate its accuracy in predicting `passed_unit_tests` on the test set.\n",
